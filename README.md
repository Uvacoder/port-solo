# My Personal Website

This is the source code for my personal website, which is hosted on Vercel. It's built with Next.js, Typescript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Features

- [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/) to send/receive emails from the form on the [contact page](https://solorio.dev/contact).
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) to host the website.
- [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) to manage DNS and SSL.
- [Lanyard](https://github.com/Phineas/lanyard) to display my discord status and current spotify song in realtime.

<sub>_Website design was heavily inspired by my friend [Alistair](https://github.com/alii)'s personal site. Go check him out ðŸ™‚_</sub>
